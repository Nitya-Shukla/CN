### **Finite State Machines (FSM)**

*   **What They Are:**
    *   A Finite State Machine (FSM), also known as a finite automaton, is a mathematical model of computation used to design and describe the behavior of systems that can be in one of a finite number of states at any given time.
    *   An FSM changes from one state to another in response to external inputs or events. These changes are called transitions.
    *   **Key Components of an FSM:**
        1.  **States (Finite Set):** A set of distinct conditions or situations the system can be in (e.g., `Idle`, `Waiting`, `Sending`, `Error`).
        2.  **Initial State:** The state the FSM starts in.
        3.  **Transitions:** Rules that define how the FSM moves from one state to another based on current state and input.
        4.  **Inputs (Alphabet):** A set of possible events or signals that can trigger transitions.
        5.  **Outputs (Optional):** Actions or signals produced by the FSM when a transition occurs or while in a particular state (associated with Mealy and Moore machines respectively).

*   **How They Model Protocols:**
    *   FSMs are widely used to specify and model the behavior of communication protocols because protocols inherently involve states, events (receiving packets, timer expiry), and actions (sending packets, starting timers).
    *   Each communicating entity (e.g., sender, receiver) in a protocol can be modeled as an FSM.
    *   **Example: Simplified Stop-and-Wait ARQ Sender FSM:**
        *   **States:**
            *   `ReadyToSendFrame0`: Ready to send frame with sequence number 0.
            *   `WaitingForACK0`: Frame 0 sent, waiting for its ACK.
            *   `ReadyToSendFrame1`: Ready to send frame with sequence number 1.
            *   `WaitingForACK1`: Frame 1 sent, waiting for its ACK.
        *   **Inputs/Events:**
            *   `AppDataReady`: Application layer has data to send.
            *   `ACK0_Rcvd`: ACK for frame 0 received.
            *   `ACK1_Rcvd`: ACK for frame 1 received.
            *   `CorruptACK_Rcvd`: A corrupted ACK is received.
            *   `Timeout`: Timer for an ACK expires.
        *   **Outputs/Actions:**
            *   `SendFrame0`: Send data frame with sequence number 0.
            *   `SendFrame1`: Send data frame with sequence number 1.
            *   `StartTimer`: Start the retransmission timer.
            *   `StopTimer`: Stop the retransmission timer.

        *   **Simplified Transitions (Conceptual):**
            1.  **State:** `ReadyToSendFrame0`
                *   **Event:** `AppDataReady`
                *   **Action:** `SendFrame0`, `StartTimer`
                *   **Next State:** `WaitingForACK0`

            2.  **State:** `WaitingForACK0`
                *   **Event:** `ACK0_Rcvd` (correct ACK)
                *   **Action:** `StopTimer`, (signal app layer data delivered)
                *   **Next State:** `ReadyToSendFrame1`
                *   **Event:** `Timeout` (or `CorruptACK_Rcvd`)
                *   **Action:** `SendFrame0` (retransmit), `StartTimer`
                *   **Next State:** `WaitingForACK0` (remain in state)

            3.  **State:** `ReadyToSendFrame1`
                *   **Event:** `AppDataReady`
                *   **Action:** `SendFrame1`, `StartTimer`
                *   **Next State:** `WaitingForACK1`

            4.  **State:** `WaitingForACK1`
                *   **Event:** `ACK1_Rcvd` (correct ACK)
                *   **Action:** `StopTimer`, (signal app layer data delivered)
                *   **Next State:** `ReadyToSendFrame0`
                *   **Event:** `Timeout` (or `CorruptACK_Rcvd`)
                *   **Action:** `SendFrame1` (retransmit), `StartTimer`
                *   **Next State:** `WaitingForACK1` (remain in state)

        *   **Diagram (Conceptual State Diagram - simplified):**
            ```mermaid
graph TD
    A[ReadyToSendFrame0] -- AppDataReady / SendFrame0, StartTimer --> B(WaitingForACK0)
    B -- ACK0_Rcvd / StopTimer --> C[ReadyToSendFrame1]
    B -- Timeout_or_CorruptACK / SendFrame0, StartTimer --> B
    C -- AppDataReady / SendFrame1, StartTimer --> D(WaitingForACK1)
    D -- ACK1_Rcvd / StopTimer --> A
    D -- Timeout_or_CorruptACK / SendFrame1, StartTimer --> D
    ```

*   **Benefits of Using FSMs for Protocols:**
    *   **Precise Specification:** FSMs provide an unambiguous way to describe protocol behavior.
    *   **Aid in Implementation:** They serve as a blueprint for writing protocol software.
    *   **Verification and Testing:** Easier to verify protocol correctness and design test cases by analyzing the FSM.
    *   **Understanding Complexity:** Helps in understanding interactions and potential issues like deadlocks or race conditions.
    *   **Clear Documentation:** State diagrams are a clear way to document protocol logic.

*   **Exam Angle (from pyqs.md):**
    *   **"What is FSM model? How used in protocols? Explain.":**
        *   Define FSM: Model with states, inputs, transitions, (optional) outputs.
        *   Explain its use in protocols: To model behavior of communicating entities, specify responses to events (packet arrival, timer expiry).
        *   Provide a simple example (like Stop-and-Wait ARQ conceptual states and transitions).
        *   Mention benefits: Precision, aids implementation, verification. 

### **Fragmentation & Reassembly**

*   **Why Needed (The Problem of MTU):**
    *   Different network technologies (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi, WAN links) have different **Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)** sizes. The MTU defines the largest size of a data packet (frame at the link layer) that a specific network link can carry.
    *   For example, Ethernet typically has an MTU of 1500 bytes.
    *   If a router receives an IP datagram that is larger than the MTU of the outgoing link it needs to send the datagram over, the router must break the datagram into smaller pieces. This process is called **fragmentation**.
    *   If fragmentation were not performed, the large datagram would be dropped by the link layer of the outgoing interface, and communication would fail.

*   **How IP Fragmentation Works (IPv4):**
    *   Fragmentation occurs at the IP layer (Network Layer).
    *   When a router needs to fragment an IP datagram, it divides the original datagram's data payload into multiple smaller pieces. Each piece becomes the data payload of a new, smaller IP datagram (a fragment).
    *   All fragments of the original datagram retain the same header information as the original datagram (source IP, destination IP, protocol, etc.), but some fields in the IP header are modified to manage the fragmentation process.
    *   **Key IP Header Fields Involved:**
        1.  **Identification (ID) (16 bits):**
            *   This field contains a unique value for each original IP datagram sent by a source.
            *   When a datagram is fragmented, **all its fragments carry the same Identification value**. This allows the destination host to identify which fragments belong to the same original datagram.
        2.  **Flags (3 bits):**
            *   **Bit 0 (Reserved):** Must be zero.
            *   **Bit 1 (DF - Don't Fragment):**
                *   If set to `1`, it means the datagram **must not be fragmented**. If a router needs to fragment this datagram but the DF bit is set, the router will drop the datagram and usually send an ICMP "Destination Unreachable (Fragmentation Needed and DF set)" error message back to the source.
                *   If set to `0`, the datagram can be fragmented if necessary.
            *   **Bit 2 (MF - More Fragments):**
                *   If set to `1`, it means this is a fragment, and there are **more fragments** following this one (i.e., this is not the last fragment of the original datagram).
                *   If set to `0`, it means this is either the **last fragment** of an original datagram, or it is an **unfragmented datagram**.
        3.  **Fragment Offset (13 bits):**
            *   This field specifies the **position of this fragment's data relative to the beginning of the original datagram's data payload**. 
            *   The offset is measured in units of **8-byte blocks**. This means the actual byte offset is `Fragment Offset field value * 8`.
            *   The first fragment will have an offset of `0` (if the original datagram was fragmented).
            *   The Fragment Offset for subsequent fragments will be the offset of the previous fragment plus the data length of the previous fragment (divided by 8).

    *   **Router Action:** Intermediate routers perform fragmentation if needed. They do not reassemble fragments; reassembly is only done by the final destination host.
    *   **Destination Host Action (Reassembly):**
        *   The destination host receives potentially out-of-order fragments from different original datagrams.
        *   It uses the **Identification** field to group fragments belonging to the same original datagram.
        *   It uses the **Fragment Offset** field and the **MF bit** to correctly order the fragments and determine when all fragments of a particular datagram have arrived.
        *   Once all fragments are received, the destination host reassembles them into the original datagram before passing the data to the higher transport layer (e.g., TCP or UDP).
        *   If any fragment is lost, the entire original datagram is considered lost (as IP provides no reliability for fragments). Higher-layer protocols (like TCP) are responsible for detecting and recovering from such losses.

*   **Example of Fragmentation:**
    *   Assume an original IP datagram:
        *   Identification: `123`
        *   Total Length: `1420 bytes` (Header: `20 bytes`, Data: `1400 bytes`)
        *   Flags: `DF=0, MF=0` (can be fragmented, is not currently a fragment)
        *   Fragment Offset: `0`
    *   This datagram needs to pass through a network with an MTU of `520 bytes`.
        *   The maximum data payload per fragment: `520 (MTU) - 20 (IP Header) = 500 bytes`.
        *   Since fragment data lengths must be multiples of 8 (due to the Fragment Offset unit), the closest multiple of 8 less than or equal to 500 is `496 bytes` (500 / 8 = 62.5, so 62 * 8 = 496).

    *   **Fragment 1:**
        *   Identification: `123`
        *   Data: `496 bytes` (bytes 0-495 of original data)
        *   Total Length: `20 (Header) + 496 (Data) = 516 bytes`
        *   Flags: `DF=0, MF=1` (More Fragments to come)
        *   Fragment Offset: `0` (0 / 8)

    *   **Fragment 2:**
        *   Identification: `123`
        *   Data: `496 bytes` (bytes 496-991 of original data)
        *   Total Length: `20 (Header) + 496 (Data) = 516 bytes`
        *   Flags: `DF=0, MF=1` (More Fragments to come)
        *   Fragment Offset: `62` (496 / 8)

    *   **Fragment 3:**
        *   Identification: `123`
        *   Original data remaining: `1400 - 496 - 496 = 408 bytes`
        *   Data: `408 bytes` (bytes 992-1399 of original data)
        *   Total Length: `20 (Header) + 408 (Data) = 428 bytes`
        *   Flags: `DF=0, MF=0` (This is the Last Fragment)
        *   Fragment Offset: `124` ((496+496) / 8)

*   **Fragmentation in IPv6:**
    *   In IPv6, fragmentation is handled differently. Routers in IPv6 **do not fragment packets**. 
    *   If an IPv6 packet is too large for a link's MTU, the router drops the packet and sends an ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big" message back to the source.
    *   The source host is then responsible for performing **end-to-end fragmentation** using an IPv6 Fragmentation Extension Header if it wants to send a packet larger than the path MTU.
    *   This simplifies router processing and makes them more efficient.

*   **Exam Angle (from pyqs.md):**
    *   **"Explain Fragmentation and reassembly using suitable example":**
        *   Explain why fragmentation is needed (MTU differences).
        *   Describe the IP header fields used: Identification, Flags (DF, MF), Fragment Offset.
        *   Walk through an example: Show an original datagram (size, data size) and how it's broken into fragments for a smaller MTU. For each fragment, specify its ID, Data size, Total Length, MF bit, and Fragment Offset.
        *   Briefly explain how the destination reassembles using these fields.

        *   Reassembly at the destination. 

### **Queuing Theory (M/M/1, Little's Theorem - Very Basic)**

*   **What is Queuing Theory?**
    *   Queuing theory is the mathematical study of waiting lines, or queues.
    *   It is used to analyze and predict the behavior of systems where entities (e.g., packets, customers, jobs) arrive for service, wait if the service facility is busy, get serviced, and then depart.
    *   In computer networks, queuing theory helps in analyzing the performance of routers, switches, and other network devices where packets queue up for transmission or processing.

*   **M/M/1 Queue (Kendall's Notation):**
    *   This is a basic and widely used queuing model.
    *   The notation `A/B/C/K/N/D` (Kendall's Notation) describes a queue, but often only the first three are specified for simpler models like M/M/1.
        *   **First M (Arrival Process):** Represents a **Markovian (or Poisson) arrival process**. This means:
            *   The number of arrivals in a given time interval follows a Poisson distribution.
            *   The inter-arrival times (time between successive arrivals) are exponentially distributed.
            *   This implies arrivals are random and independent of each other.
        *   **Second M (Service Time Distribution):** Represents **Markovian (or Exponential) service times**. This means:
            *   The time taken to service an entity is exponentially distributed.
            *   This is a common assumption for analytical tractability.
        *   **1 (Number of Servers):** Represents a **single server** facility.
    *   **Assumptions for M/M/1:**
        *   Infinite queue capacity (no packets are dropped due to buffer overflow in the basic model).
        *   FIFO (First-In, First-Out) or FCFS (First-Come, First-Served) queue discipline.
        *   The arrival rate (λ) must be less than the service rate (μ) for the queue to be stable (i.e., ρ = λ/μ < 1, where ρ is the server utilization).

*   **Little's Theorem (Little's Law):**
    *   Little's Theorem is a fundamental and remarkably simple relationship in queuing theory that applies to any stable system in steady state, regardless of the arrival distribution, service distribution, or number of servers.
    *   **Formula:** `L = λW`
    *   **Terms:**
        *   `L`: **Average number of items (customers/packets) in the queuing system** (including those being served and those waiting in the queue).
        *   `λ` (Lambda): **Average effective arrival rate** of items into the system (items per unit time).
        *   `W`: **Average waiting time an item spends in the system** (including both time spent waiting in the queue and time spent being served).

    *   **Conceptual Application & Importance:**
        *   It provides a direct way to relate the average number of items in a system to the average time an item spends in that system.
        *   For example, if we know that on average 20 packets arrive per second at a router (`λ = 20 packets/sec`), and the average time a packet spends at the router (waiting and transmission) is 0.1 seconds (`W = 0.1 sec`), then the average number of packets in the router system at any time is `L = 20 * 0.1 = 2 packets`.
        *   It can also be applied to just the queue itself:
            *   `Lq = λWq`
            *   Where `Lq` is the average number of items waiting in the queue, and `Wq` is the average time an item spends waiting in the queue (excluding service time).
    *   **Key Insight:** You can determine one of the variables if the other two are known, making it useful for performance analysis and capacity planning.

*   **Focus for Exam:**
    *   Conceptual understanding is usually sufficient for typical Computer Networks exams unless specific queuing theory courses are involved.
    *   No deep mathematical derivations are usually expected, but understanding the terms and how to apply Little's Law is important.

*   **Exam Angle (from pyqs.md):**
    *   **"Explain Little's theorem":**
        *   State the formula: `L = λW`.
        *   Clearly define each term: `L` (avg number in system), `λ` (avg arrival rate), `W` (avg time in system).
        *   Explain its significance (relates these three key performance metrics, widely applicable).
        *   Provide a simple conceptual example of its application.
    *   **"What is M/M/1?":**
        *   Explain the Kendall notation: M (Poisson/Exponential arrivals), M (Exponential service times), 1 (single server).
        *   Briefly describe what each component signifies.
        *   Mention it's a basic queuing model. 

### **IEEE 802 Series (General Awareness)**

*   **What is IEEE 802?**
    *   The IEEE 802 series is a **family of IEEE standards** dealing with **Local Area Networks (LANs)** and **Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs)**.
    *   These standards primarily define the **Physical Layer (Layer 1)** and the **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)** of the OSI model for wired and wireless networks.
    *   The Data Link Layer is often subdivided in the IEEE 802 context into two sublayers:
        1.  **Logical Link Control (LLC) Sublayer (IEEE 802.2):** Provides an interface to the Network Layer and is responsible for error control, flow control, and framing. It was intended to be common across different MAC layers.
        2.  **Media Access Control (MAC) Sublayer:** Specific to the type of medium and network, responsible for controlling access to the shared medium, MAC addressing, and some framing aspects.

*   **Key IEEE 802 Standards (Mention a few and what they cover):**

    | Standard      | Common Name/Technology | Brief Description                                                                                                |

### **FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface)**

*   **What is FDDI?**
    *   FDDI is a standard for data transmission in a **Local Area Network (LAN)** that uses **fiber optic cables** as the primary physical medium.
    *   It was developed by ANSI (American National Standards Institute) in the mid-1980s as a high-speed (100 Mbps) alternative to then-slower Ethernet and Token Ring networks, particularly for backbone networks.

*   **Key Characteristics:**
    1.  **Token Passing Access Method:**
        *   FDDI uses a token-passing mechanism, similar to Token Ring (IEEE 802.5), to control access to the network. A special frame, the "token," circulates around the ring. A station must capture the token before it can transmit data.
        *   This provides deterministic access, unlike the contention-based CSMA/CD used in Ethernet.
    2.  **Dual Ring Topology:**
        *   FDDI employs a **dual counter-rotating ring** topology for reliability and fault tolerance.
        *   It consists of two independent fiber optic rings: a **primary ring** and a **secondary ring**.
        *   Normally, data travels on the primary ring. The secondary ring remains idle or can be used for additional data capacity.
        *   **Fault Tolerance:** If a link in the primary ring breaks or a station fails, the network can automatically reconfigure itself by "wrapping" the primary ring onto the secondary ring, effectively forming a single, larger ring and maintaining connectivity. This makes FDDI highly resilient.
        *   **Diagram (Conceptual Dual Ring with Wrap):**

### **Service Primitives**

*   **Definition:**
    *   Service Primitives are abstract operations that define the services provided by one layer in a layered network architecture to the layer immediately above it.
    *   They specify the interface between adjacent layers, describing the functions available and the form these functions take.
    *   They do not specify how the service is implemented within the lower layer, only what service is offered to the upper layer.

*   **Types of Primitives (Common Set):**
    Most services can be described using a set of four common primitives:
    1.  **`REQUEST`:** An entity in a higher layer (service user) invokes this primitive to request a service from a lower layer (service provider). It passes parameters needed to specify the requested service (e.g., destination address, data to be sent).
        *   *Example: Layer N entity requests Layer N-1 to send a packet.*_x000D_
    2.  **`INDICATION`:** The service provider (lower layer) invokes this primitive to notify a service user (higher layer) at the *destination* side that a significant event has occurred (e.g., arrival of data, connection request from a peer).
        *   *Example: Layer N-1 at the receiver informs Layer N that a packet has arrived.*_x000D_
    3.  **`RESPONSE`:** The service user (higher layer) at the destination side invokes this primitive to respond to an `INDICATION` from a lower layer. It acknowledges or completes a service requested by its peer.
        *   *Example: Layer N at the receiver responds to Layer N-1, perhaps acknowledging receipt or accepting a connection.*_x000D_
    4.  **`CONFIRM`:** The service provider (lower layer) at the *initiating* side invokes this primitive to inform the service user (higher layer) that a previously requested service (via `REQUEST`) has been completed, and what the outcome was (success or failure).
        *   *Example: Layer N-1 at the sender confirms to Layer N that the packet was successfully transmitted (or failed to transmit).*_x000D_

*   **Simple Example of Interaction (Connection Setup - Confirmed Service):**
    Imagine Layer N+1 wants to establish a connection with its peer using services from Layer N.

    ```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UserA_LayerN+1 as Layer N+1 (User A)
    participant ProviderA_LayerN as Layer N (Provider A at User A's side)
    participant ProviderB_LayerN as Layer N (Provider B at User B's side)
    participant UserB_LayerN+1 as Layer N+1 (User B)

    UserA_LayerN+1->>ProviderA_LayerN: N-CONNECT.request (DestinationAddress)
    Note over ProviderA_LayerN,ProviderB_LayerN: Layer N protocol action (e.g., send connection request packet)
    ProviderB_LayerN->>UserB_LayerN+1: N-CONNECT.indication (SourceAddress)
    UserB_LayerN+1->>ProviderB_LayerN: N-CONNECT.response (Accept/Reject)
    Note over ProviderB_LayerN,ProviderA_LayerN: Layer N protocol action (e.g., send connection accept packet)
    ProviderA_LayerN->>UserA_LayerN+1: N-CONNECT.confirm (Status: Success/Failure)
    end
    ```

    *   **Flow:**
        1.  **User A (Layer N+1)** wants to connect to User B. It issues an `N-CONNECT.request` to its local Layer N provider, specifying User B's address.
        2.  **Layer N (Provider A)** takes action (e.g., sends a connection request packet across the network to Layer N at User B's side).
        3.  **Layer N (Provider B)** at User B's side receives the request. It informs its **User B (Layer N+1)** by issuing an `N-CONNECT.indication`.
        4.  **User B (Layer N+1)** decides whether to accept the connection and issues an `N-CONNECT.response` (e.g., accept) to its Layer N provider.
        5.  **Layer N (Provider B)** takes action (e.g., sends a connection accept packet back to Layer N at User A's side).
        6.  **Layer N (Provider A)** at User A's side receives the confirmation. It informs its **User A (Layer N+1)** by issuing an `N-CONNECT.confirm`, indicating whether the connection was successfully established.

*   **Unconfirmed Service:** Some services are unconfirmed, meaning they only involve `REQUEST` and `INDICATION` primitives (e.g., sending a datagram without acknowledgment at that layer).

*   **Importance:**
    *   **Abstraction:** They hide the complexity of the lower layer's operations.
    *   **Standardization:** They provide a well-defined way for layers to interact, promoting modularity and interoperability in network protocol design.

*   **Exam Angle:**
    *   **"Short note on Service Primitives":**
        *   Define service primitives: Abstract operations defining services between adjacent layers.
        *   List and briefly describe the four common types: REQUEST, INDICATION, RESPONSE, CONFIRM.
        *   Provide a simple example or diagram illustrating their sequence for a confirmed service (like connection setup or data transfer).
        *   Mention their role in abstraction and standardization. 

### **Frame Relay**

*   **Definition:**
    *   Frame Relay is a **Wide Area Network (WAN)** communication protocol that operates at the **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)** of the OSI model.
    *   It was designed to be an efficient way to transmit data between Local Area Networks (LANs) or end-points over a digital network.
    *   It provides a **connection-oriented** service, meaning a path is established before data transfer begins.

*   **Key Characteristics:**
    1.  **Packet-Switched Technology:** Frame Relay is a packet-switching technology, but it streamlines the process compared to older X.25 networks by performing less error checking.
    2.  **Virtual Circuits (VCs):**
        *   Frame Relay uses **virtual circuits** to connect devices. A virtual circuit is a logical connection between two network devices, rather than a dedicated physical circuit.
        *   The path taken by packets can vary, but the logical connection appears fixed to the end devices.
        *   **Data Link Connection Identifier (DLCI):** Each virtual circuit is identified by a DLCI, which is a locally significant number (meaning it only has significance on the specific link between the user device (DTE) and the network switch (DCE)).
        *   Two types of Virtual Circuits:
            *   **Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVCs):** These are pre-configured by the network provider and are always available. They are analogous to a leased line. This is the most common type.
            *   **Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs):** These are established dynamically on demand, similar to a phone call. The connection is set up when needed and torn down when finished. SVCs are less common in Frame Relay deployments.
    3.  **Connection-Oriented at DLL:**
        *   Although Frame Relay itself doesn't perform elaborate call setup for PVCs (as they are permanent), the service it provides is connection-oriented. Data follows the established logical path (VC).
        *   For SVCs, an explicit call setup and teardown process occurs.
    4.  **No Hop-by-Hop Error Control or Flow Control:**
        *   Frame Relay was designed for use over reliable digital transmission lines (like fiber optics).
        *   It assumes that error rates will be low, so it **does not perform error correction or flow control on a hop-by-hop basis** within the Frame Relay network.
        *   Error detection (e.g., via FCS in the frame) is done, and corrupted frames are typically discarded.
        *   End-to-end error control and flow control are left to higher-layer protocols (like TCP at the Transport Layer).
        *   This simplification makes Frame Relay faster and more efficient than older WAN protocols like X.25.
    5.  **Variable-Length Frames:** Frame Relay transmits data in variable-length packets called frames.

*   **Frame Relay Frame Format (Simplified):**
    *   **Flag:** Marks beginning and end of frame (e.g., 01111110).
    *   **Header:** Contains the DLCI (to identify the VC), congestion notification bits (FECN, BECN), and DE (Discard Eligibility) bit.
    *   **Data:** The user's data (payload from higher layers).
    *   **FCS (Frame Check Sequence):** For error detection.
    *   **Flag:** Marks end of frame.

*   **Use Cases (Historically):**
    *   Connecting LANs across geographically dispersed locations.
    *   Providing cost-effective WAN connectivity for businesses.

*   **Relevance Today:**
    *   Frame Relay is largely a legacy technology.
    *   It has been widely replaced by newer technologies like MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) and various forms of Ethernet WAN services, which offer higher speeds, more features, and better integration with IP networks.

*   **Exam Angle:**
    *   **"Short Note on Frame Relay":**
        *   Define: WAN protocol, operates at Data Link Layer.
        *   Key Features: Packet-switched, uses Virtual Circuits (PVCs mainly, SVCs).
        *   Mention DLCI for VC identification.
        *   State it's connection-oriented at DLL.
        *   Note its reduced error checking for efficiency, relying on higher layers.
        *   Briefly mention it's a legacy technology largely replaced by MPLS/Ethernet WAN.
