### **DNS (Domain Name System)**

*   **Purpose:**
    *   The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network.
    *   Its primary function is to **translate human-readable domain names** (e.g., `www.google.com`) into machine-readable **IP addresses** (e.g., `172.217.160.142` for IPv4 or `2607:f8b0:4004:804::200e` for IPv6).
    *   It can also perform reverse lookups: translating IP addresses back into domain names.
    *   DNS makes the internet more user-friendly, as users can remember names instead of numerical IP addresses.
    *   It also provides a level of indirection, allowing the IP address associated with a service to change without users needing to know the new IP address (they just continue using the domain name).

*   **Hierarchical Structure:**
    *   DNS has a tree-like structure. The hierarchy consists of several levels:
        1.  **Root Level:** At the very top, denoted by a `.` (dot), though often implicit. Managed by ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).
        2.  **Top-Level Domains (TLDs):** These are the suffixes like `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, `.gov`, `.edu`, and country-code TLDs (ccTLDs) like `.uk`, `.in`, `.de`.
        3.  **Second-Level Domains (SLDs):** These are the names registered by organizations or individuals directly under a TLD (e.g., `google` in `google.com`, `wikipedia` in `wikipedia.org`).
        4.  **Subdomains:** Further subdivisions of SLDs (e.g., `mail.google.com`, `en.wikipedia.org`, where `mail` and `en` are subdomains).
        5.  **Hostnames:** The actual name of a specific machine (e.g., `www` in `www.example.com`).

    *   **Simple Hierarchy Diagram:**
        ```
                      . (Root)
                     /|\
                    / | \
                   /  |  \
レベル1 (TLD)   .com .org .edu ...
                 |    |    |
レベル2 (SLD) google wikipedia stanford ...
                 |      |       |
レベル3 (Subdomain) www    en      cs  ...
        ```

    *   **Authoritative Name Servers:** For each **zone** (a portion of the domain namespace), there are authoritative name servers that hold the definitive DNS records for that zone. For example, Google runs the authoritative name servers for the `google.com` zone.

*   **Resolver (DNS Client):**
    *   A DNS resolver is a client-side program or library (often part of the operating system) that initiates DNS queries on behalf of an application (e.g., a web browser, email client).
    *   When an application needs to resolve a domain name, it passes the request to the local resolver.
    *   The resolver typically queries one or more configured DNS servers (e.g., provided by an ISP, a public DNS service like Google Public DNS `8.8.8.8` or Cloudflare `1.1.1.1`, or a local network router).

*   **Iterative vs. Recursive Queries:**

    1.  **Recursive Query:**
        *   **Concept:** The resolver asks its configured DNS server (e.g., ISP DNS server) to perform the full resolution process.
        *   **Mechanism:**
            1.  Client resolver sends a recursive query for `www.example.com` to its local DNS server.
            2.  The local DNS server takes responsibility. If it doesn't know the answer (not cached), it queries a root server.
            3.  The root server might refer it to a TLD server for `.com`.
            4.  The local DNS server then queries the `.com` TLD server.
            5.  The TLD server might refer it to the authoritative name server for `example.com`.
            6.  The local DNS server queries the `example.com` authoritative server, which returns the IP address for `www.example.com`.
            7.  The local DNS server sends the final IP address back to the client resolver.
        *   **Diagram (Conceptual Flow for Recursive to Local DNS, then Local DNS Iterates):**
            ```
            Client Resolver  --- Recursive Query (www.example.com) ---> Local DNS Server
                                                                          |
                                                                          | (if not cached)
                                                                          v
                                                                        Root Server --(refers to .com server)--> Local DNS Server
                                                                                                                  |
                                                                                                                  v
                                                                                                                .com TLD Server --(refers to example.com server)--> Local DNS Server
                                                                                                                                                            |
                                                                                                                                                            v
                                                                                                                                                          example.com Auth Server --(IP for www)--> Local DNS Server
            Client Resolver  <--- IP Address ------------------------- Local DNS Server
            ```
        *   The burden of resolution is on the queried DNS server.

    2.  **Iterative Query:**
        *   **Concept:** The resolver asks a DNS server for the answer. If the server doesn't know, it provides a referral to another DNS server that might know (closer to the target). The resolver then queries that referred server, and so on.
        *   **Mechanism (Typical interaction between DNS servers):** When a local DNS server (acting as a client to other servers) performs resolution after receiving a recursive query from an end-user resolver, it typically uses iterative queries to root servers, TLD servers, and authoritative servers.
            1.  Resolver asks Server A: "What is IP for `www.example.com`?"
            2.  Server A (e.g., root server) replies: "I don't know, but try Server B (a .com TLD server)."
            3.  Resolver asks Server B: "What is IP for `www.example.com`?"
            4.  Server B replies: "I don't know, but try Server C (the authoritative server for `example.com`)."
            5.  Resolver asks Server C: "What is IP for `www.example.com`?"
            6.  Server C replies with the IP address.
        *   The resolver does the work of chasing referrals.

*   **Common DNS Record Types (Resource Records - RRs):**

    | Type   | Name                       | Purpose                                                                 |
    |--------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | **A**  | Address Record             | Maps a hostname to an **IPv4 address** (e.g., `192.0.2.1`).             |
    | **AAAA**| IPv6 Address Record        | Maps a hostname to an **IPv6 address** (e.g., `2001:0db8::1`).          |
    | **CNAME**| Canonical Name Record      | Creates an **alias** from one domain name to another (the canonical name). The DNS resolution continues with the canonical name. (e.g., `ftp.example.com` might be a CNAME to `server1.example.com`). |
    | **MX** | Mail Exchange Record       | Specifies the **mail server(s)** responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a domain. Includes a preference value to prioritize servers. |
    | **NS** | Name Server Record         | Delegates a DNS zone to use the given **authoritative name servers**.     |
    | **PTR**| Pointer Record             | Used for **reverse DNS lookups**; maps an IP address to a hostname. Resides in `in-addr.arpa` (IPv4) or `ip6.arpa` (IPv6) domains. |
    | **SOA**| Start of Authority Record  | Provides authoritative information about the DNS zone, including the primary name server, email of the domain administrator, domain serial number, and timers relating to refreshing the zone. |
    | **TXT**| Text Record                | Allows administrators to insert arbitrary text into a DNS record. Used for various purposes, like SPF (Sender Policy Framework) for email validation or domain ownership verification. |
    | **SRV**| Service Record             | Specifies the hostname and port number of servers for specified services (e.g., LDAP, XMPP). |

*   **DNS Caching:**
    *   To improve performance and reduce DNS traffic, DNS responses are cached at various levels:
        *   **Client OS/Resolver Cache:** Your computer often caches recent DNS lookups.
        *   **Local DNS Server Cache (e.g., ISP server):** These servers cache responses they get from other servers.
    *   Each DNS record has a **Time-To-Live (TTL)** value specified by the authoritative name server. This value tells caches how long they are allowed to store and use the record before it should be refreshed (requeried from an authoritative server).
    *   Caching reduces latency for users (if a lookup is cached locally or nearby) and reduces the load on authoritative name servers.

*   **Exam Angle (from pyqs.md):**
    *   **"Explain services provided by DNS":**
        *   Primary service: Domain name to IP address translation (and vice-versa).
        *   Enables use of memorable names instead of IP addresses.
        *   Provides indirection (IP can change, name remains).
        *   Facilitates load distribution (multiple A records for one name) and service location (MX, SRV records).
        *   Hierarchical and distributed database.
    *   **"Short Note on DNS":**
        *   Purpose (name-to-IP).
        *   Hierarchical structure (root, TLD, SLD).
        *   Key components (resolver, name servers).
        *   Mention query types (recursive/iterative concept).
        *   Mention caching and TTL.
    *   Focus on understanding the difference between iterative and recursive queries and being able to explain the general lookup process.
    *   Know the purpose of the main record types (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS). 

### **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**

*   **Purpose:**
    *   HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (WWW).
    *   It is an **application-layer protocol** used for fetching resources, primarily HTML documents, but also images, videos, stylesheets, scripts, etc.
    *   HTTP defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands.
    *   Typically uses TCP as its underlying transport protocol (usually on port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS - HTTP Secure).

*   **Client-Server Model:**
    *   HTTP operates as a **request-response** protocol in a client-server computing model.
    *   **Client (User Agent):** Typically a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) or any other program that initiates a request to a server. The client sends an HTTP request message to the server.
    *   **Server (Origin Server):** Typically a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx, IIS) that stores or can dynamically generate resources. The server processes the client's request and sends back an HTTP response message, which might contain the requested resource or an error message.
    *   Each request-response pair is independent, making HTTP a **stateless protocol** by default. This means the server does not retain any information about past requests from a particular client. (State can be maintained using cookies or session management techniques built on top of HTTP).

*   **Persistent vs. Non-persistent Connections:**

    1.  **Non-Persistent HTTP (HTTP/1.0 default):**
        *   **Mechanism:** A new TCP connection is established for *each* HTTP request/response pair (i.e., for each object to be fetched - HTML file, each image, each script).
        *   **Steps for fetching one object:**
            1.  Client opens a TCP connection to the server.
            2.  Client sends an HTTP request for the object.
            3.  Server sends the HTTP response containing the object.
            4.  Server closes the TCP connection.
        *   **Overhead/Disadvantages:**
            *   High latency: Each object requires a separate TCP connection setup (3-way handshake) and teardown (4-way handshake).
            *   Inefficient: Multiple RTTs per object.
            *   Resource intensive for the server (managing many short-lived connections).

    2.  **Persistent HTTP (HTTP/1.1 default):**
        *   **Mechanism:** The TCP connection remains open after a request/response exchange, allowing multiple subsequent requests and responses to be sent over the same connection before it is eventually closed.
        *   **Types:**
            *   **Without Pipelining:** Client sends a request, waits for the response, then sends the next request over the same connection.
            *   **With Pipelining (less common now due to complexities and HTTP/2):** Client sends multiple requests over the same connection without waiting for each response. Responses must be received in the same order as requests.
        *   **Benefits:**
            *   Reduced latency: Avoids repeated TCP connection setup/teardown for multiple objects from the same server.
            *   Lower overhead for client and server.
            *   Faster page loading.
        *   **Connection Closure:** The connection can be closed by either the client or the server after a timeout period or by using the `Connection: close` header.
    *   **HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 further optimize connections** using techniques like multiplexing multiple requests/responses over a single TCP (HTTP/2) or QUIC (HTTP/3) connection.

*   **HTTP Message Format (General Structure):**
    *   HTTP messages are human-readable text. There are two types: Request messages and Response messages.

    1.  **Request Message:**
        *   **Start Line (Request Line):**
            *   `Method SP Request-URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF`
            *   Example: `GET /index.html HTTP/1.1`
            *   **Method:** Indicates the action to be performed (e.g., `GET`, `POST`, `HEAD`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
            *   **Request-URI:** Specifies the resource to which the request applies (e.g., `/path/to/resource.html`).
            *   **HTTP-Version:** The version of HTTP being used (e.g., `HTTP/1.0`, `HTTP/1.1`, `HTTP/2`).
        *   **Header Lines (Request Headers):**
            *   `Header-Name: Header-Value CRLF`
            *   Provide additional information about the request or the client.
            *   Examples:
                *   `Host: www.example.com` (Required in HTTP/1.1; specifies the domain name of the server).
                *   `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) ...` (Identifies the client software).
                *   `Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8` (Content types client can understand).
                *   `Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5`
                *   `Connection: keep-alive` (For persistent connections).
                *   `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (For POST requests, specifies type of body).
                *   `Content-Length: 348` (For POST requests, length of the message body in bytes).
        *   **Empty Line (CRLF):** A blank line separates headers from the message body.
        *   **Message Body (Optional):**
            *   Contains data being sent to the server (e.g., form data in a POST request, uploaded file).
            *   Not present in GET or HEAD requests.

    2.  **Response Message:**
        *   **Start Line (Status Line):**
            *   `HTTP-Version SP Status-Code SP Reason-Phrase CRLF`
            *   Example: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`
            *   **HTTP-Version:** Version of HTTP.
            *   **Status-Code:** A 3-digit number indicating the result of the request.
            *   **Reason-Phrase:** A short, human-readable explanation of the status code.
        *   **Header Lines (Response Headers):**
            *   `Header-Name: Header-Value CRLF`
            *   Provide additional information about the response or the server.
            *   Examples:
                *   `Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT`
                *   `Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Linux)`
                *   `Last-Modified: Wed, 22 Jul 2009 19:15:56 GMT`
                *   `Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8` (Specifies the media type of the resource in the body).
                *   `Content-Length: 155` (Length of the message body in bytes).
                *   `Connection: close`
        *   **Empty Line (CRLF):** Separates headers from the message body.
        *   **Message Body (Optional):**
            *   Contains the requested resource (e.g., HTML document, image data) or an error message.
            *   Not present in responses to HEAD requests or some error responses.

*   **Common HTTP Methods:**

    | Method  | Description                                                                       |
    |---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
    | `GET`   | Requests a representation of the specified resource. Should only retrieve data.   |
    | `POST`  | Submits data to be processed (e.g., form data, file upload) to the identified resource. Often results in a change in state or side effects on the server. |
    | `HEAD`  | Same as GET, but requests only the headers and not the actual resource body. Useful for checking resource metadata (like last modified time) without downloading the content. |
    | `PUT`   | Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload. |
    | `DELETE`| Deletes the specified resource.                                                     |
    | `OPTIONS`| Describes the communication options for the target resource.                     |
    | `CONNECT`| Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.           |
    | `TRACE` | Performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.         |

*   **Common HTTP Status Codes (grouped by category):**

    *   **1xx (Informational):** Request received, continuing process.
        *   `100 Continue`
    *   **2xx (Successful):** The action was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
        *   `200 OK`: Standard response for successful HTTP requests.
        *   `201 Created`: Request has been fulfilled, and a new resource created.
        *   `204 No Content`: Server successfully processed request but has no content to return.
    *   **3xx (Redirection):** Further action must be taken in order to complete the request.
        *   `301 Moved Permanently`: Resource has been permanently moved to a new URI.
        *   `302 Found` (or `307 Temporary Redirect`): Resource temporarily under a different URI.
        *   `304 Not Modified`: Resource has not changed since last request (used with conditional GETs).
    *   **4xx (Client Error):** The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.
        *   `400 Bad Request`: Server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.
        *   `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided.
        *   `403 Forbidden`: Server understood the request, but refuses to authorize it.
        *   `404 Not Found`: Server cannot find the requested resource.
    *   **5xx (Server Error):** The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.
        *   `500 Internal Server Error`: A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered.
        *   `503 Service Unavailable`: Server is currently unavailable (overloaded or down for maintenance).

*   **Exam Angle (from pyqs.md):**
    *   **"Request/Response message format":**
        *   Explain the general structure: Start line, Headers, Empty line, Body.
        *   For Request: Method, URI, HTTP Version; common headers (Host, User-Agent, Accept, Content-Type, Content-Length).
        *   For Response: HTTP Version, Status Code, Reason Phrase; common headers (Date, Server, Content-Type, Content-Length, Last-Modified).
    *   **"Persistent vs. Non-persistent":**
        *   Explain the difference in terms of TCP connection usage per object.
        *   Advantages of persistent (reduced latency, efficiency) vs. disadvantages of non-persistent (high overhead).
        *   Mention HTTP/1.0 default (non-persistent) vs. HTTP/1.1 default (persistent).
    *   **"Short Note on HTTP":**
        *   Purpose (WWW data transfer).
        *   Client-server, request-response model.
        *   Stateless nature.
        *   Briefly mention persistent vs. non-persistent connections.
        *   Mention key methods (GET, POST) and status code categories (2xx, 4xx). 

### **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**

*   **Purpose:**
    *   SMTP is the standard protocol for **sending (pushing) electronic mail (email)** messages from a Mail User Agent (MUA - e.g., Outlook, Thunderbird) to a Mail Transfer Agent (MTA - mail server), and between MTAs to relay email towards its destination.
    *   It is a **push protocol**; it cannot be used to "pull" messages from a server (that's what protocols like POP3 or IMAP are for).
    *   SMTP is responsible for the transmission of email, not for its storage or retrieval from mailboxes by end-users.

*   **Underlying Protocol:** SMTP typically uses **TCP on port 25** to ensure reliable delivery of email messages.

*   **Basic Commands & Interaction (Conceptual Understanding):**
    *   SMTP communication involves a series of text-based commands sent by the client (sending MTA or MUA) and responses from the server (receiving MTA).
    *   The interaction typically follows these phases:
        1.  **Connection Setup:** Client establishes a TCP connection to the server on port 25.
        2.  **Handshake/Greeting:**
            *   Server sends a `220 <server_domain> Service ready` greeting.
            *   Client sends `HELO <client_domain>` or `EHLO <client_domain>` (Extended HELO, preferred, indicates support for extensions).
            *   Server responds with `250 OK`.
        3.  **Mail Transaction:**
            *   **`MAIL FROM: <sender@example.com>`:** Client specifies the sender's email address.
                *   Server responds `250 OK` if accepted.
            *   **`RCPT TO: <recipient@example.org>`:** Client specifies the recipient's email address. Can be sent multiple times for multiple recipients.
                *   Server responds `250 OK` for each valid recipient, or an error code (e.g., `550 No such user here`).
            *   **`DATA`:** Client indicates it's ready to send the email content.
                *   Server responds `354 Start mail input; end with <CRLF>.<CRLF>`.
            *   **Email Content:** Client sends the email headers (e.g., `From:`, `To:`, `Subject:`) followed by a blank line, then the email body. The entire message is terminated by a line containing only a period (`.`).
                *   Example:
                    ```
                    From: user1@sender.com
                    To: user2@receiver.com
                    Subject: Hello

                    This is the body of the email.
                    .
                    ```
            *   Server responds `250 OK: message accepted for delivery` or an error.
        4.  **Connection Termination:**
            *   **`QUIT`:** Client requests to close the connection.
            *   Server responds `221 <server_domain> Service closing transmission channel` and closes the TCP connection.

*   **Key SMTP Commands:**

    | Command      | Description                                                        |
    |--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | `HELO`       | (Hello) Client identifies itself to the server (older).            |
    | `EHLO`       | (Extended Hello) Client identifies itself and requests extended mode. |
    | `MAIL FROM:` | Specifies the sender's email address.                                |
    | `RCPT TO:`   | Specifies the recipient's email address.                             |
    | `DATA`       | Indicates that the following lines are the email message content.    |
    | `RSET`       | Resets the current mail transaction (aborts it).                     |
    | `VRFY`       | Verifies if a username is valid on the server (often disabled).    |
    | `NOOP`       | (No Operation) Server responds with OK; keeps connection alive.      |
    | `QUIT`       | Terminates the SMTP session.                                         |
    | `HELP`       | Asks server for help information on commands.                        |

*   **Not for Retrieving Mail:**
    *   It's crucial to understand that SMTP is exclusively for **sending** email.
    *   To retrieve emails from a mailbox on a mail server, Mail User Agents use other protocols like:
        *   **POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3):** Downloads emails to the client, often deleting them from the server.
        *   **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):** Allows managing emails directly on the server, synchronizing across multiple clients.

### **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)**

*   **Purpose:**
    *   SNMP is an application-layer protocol used for **managing and monitoring network devices** on an IP network.
    *   It allows network administrators to query and configure network devices (like routers, switches, servers, printers, firewalls) remotely.
    *   Key functions include:
        *   Monitoring network performance (e.g., bandwidth utilization, error rates).
        *   Detecting and diagnosing network faults.
        *   Configuring network devices.
        *   Collecting statistics about network usage.

*   **Underlying Protocol:** SNMP typically uses **UDP** as its transport protocol. Port 161 is commonly used for SNMP messages (GET, SET requests) from manager to agent, and port 162 is used for TRAP messages (asynchronous notifications) from agent to manager.

*   **Components:** SNMP architecture involves three main components:

    1.  **SNMP Manager (Network Management Station - NMS):**
        *   A software application (or suite of applications) that runs on a centralized computer (the NMS).
        *   The manager is responsible for initiating requests to managed devices, receiving responses, and receiving asynchronous trap messages.
        *   It provides the interface for network administrators to view network status, analyze data, and control devices.

    2.  **SNMP Agent:**
        *   A software module that runs on each managed network device (e.g., router, switch, server).
        *   The agent has access to local management information on the device.
        *   It responds to requests from the SNMP manager (e.g., provides requested data values).
        *   It can also proactively send TRAP messages to the manager if significant events occur on the device (e.g., a link going down, a device rebooting).

    3.  **Management Information Base (MIB):**
        *   The MIB is a **hierarchical database** that defines all the manageable objects on a network device.
        *   Each object in the MIB represents a piece of information that can be queried or (sometimes) set by the SNMP manager (e.g., system uptime, interface status, number of packets received on an interface, CPU utilization).
        *   MIBs are defined using a standardized notation called **SMI (Structure of Management Information)**, which is based on ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One).
        *   Objects in the MIB are identified by **Object Identifiers (OIDs)**, which are long sequences of numbers that uniquely specify the object within the MIB tree (e.g., `.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0` for system description).
        *   There are standard MIBs (e.g., MIB-II, which is common to most TCP/IP devices) and vendor-specific (private) MIBs that define objects unique to a particular manufacturer's device.

*   **Basic SNMP Operations (Protocol Data Units - PDUs):**

    SNMP messages (PDUs) carry out the following primary operations:

    1.  **`GET` (or `GetRequest`):**
        *   Sent by the manager to an agent to retrieve the value of one or more MIB objects (specified by their OIDs).
        *   Example: Manager asks for the current operational status of an interface.

    2.  **`GETNEXT` (or `GetNextRequest`):**
        *   Sent by the manager to an agent to retrieve the value of the *next* MIB object in the MIB tree after a specified OID.
        *   Useful for systematically walking through a MIB or a table of objects without knowing all OIDs in advance.

    3.  **`GETBULK` (or `GetBulkRequest`) (SNMPv2 and later):**
        *   Sent by the manager to an agent to retrieve a large amount of data, typically multiple rows from a table, in a single request.
        *   More efficient than multiple `GETNEXT` requests for large data transfers.

    4.  **`SET` (or `SetRequest`):**
        *   Sent by the manager to an agent to modify the value of one or more writable MIB objects.
        *   Example: Manager changes the administrative status of an interface (e.g., to shut it down).

    5.  **`TRAP` (SNMPv1) / `INFORM` (SNMPv2c/v3):**
        *   **`TRAP`:** An unsolicited (asynchronous) message sent by an agent to a manager to report a significant event (e.g., link failure, device restart, authentication failure). Traps are unacknowledged.
        *   **`INFORM` (or `InformRequest`):** Similar to a TRAP, but it is acknowledged by the manager. This provides more reliability for critical event notifications. (SNMPv2c and later).

    6.  **`RESPONSE` (or `GetResponse`):**
        *   Sent by an agent back to the manager in reply to `GET`, `GETNEXT`, `GETBULK`, or `SET` requests. Contains the requested data or an error indication.

*   **SNMP Versions:**
    *   **SNMPv1:** The original version. Simple, but lacked robust security (used community strings as a weak form of authentication) and had limited data types.
    *   **SNMPv2c:** Introduced `GetBulkRequest` for efficiency and improved error handling. Still used community strings for security ("c" for community-based).
    *   **SNMPv3:** The current standard. Provides significant security enhancements:
        *   **Authentication:** Verifies the identity of the sender.
        *   **Encryption (Privacy):** Encrypts SNMP messages to prevent eavesdropping.
        *   **Access Control:** Defines what operations are allowed for specific users on specific MIB objects.

*   **Exam Angle (from pyqs.md):**
    *   **"Explain SNMP and its functions":**
        *   Purpose: Network management and monitoring.
        *   Key functions: Monitoring performance, fault detection, configuration.
        *   Components: Manager (NMS), Agent, MIB.
            *   Briefly describe the role of each.
            *   Explain what a MIB is (hierarchical database of managed objects, OIDs).
        *   Basic Operations: Mention `GET`, `SET`, and `TRAP` as the core operations.
        *   Briefly touch upon UDP usage.
    *   **"Short Note on SNMP":** A concise summary of the above points. 

### **Electronic Mail (General Components & Flow)**

*   **What is Electronic Mail (Email)?**
    *   Electronic mail is a method of exchanging digital messages between people using electronic devices.
    *   It operates on a store-and-forward model, where email messages are sent through a series of mail servers to reach the recipient's mailbox.

*   **Key Components of an Email System:**

    1.  **Mail User Agent (MUA):**
        *   The MUA is the software application that end-users interact with to compose, send, receive, and read email messages.
        *   **Examples:**
            *   Desktop clients: Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, Apple Mail.
            *   Webmail interfaces: Gmail, Outlook.com, Yahoo Mail (accessed via a web browser).
            *   Mobile email apps.
        *   **Functions:**
            *   Provides an interface for users to write and format emails.
            *   Allows users to read and manage received emails (organize into folders, delete, etc.).
            *   For sending email, the MUA typically communicates with a Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) using SMTP.
            *   For retrieving email, the MUA communicates with a mail server using protocols like POP3 or IMAP.

    2.  **Mail Transfer Agent (MTA):**
        *   The MTA is server software responsible for routing and relaying email messages from the sender to the recipient's mail server.
        *   Also known as a mail server or mail relay.
        *   **Examples:** Postfix, Sendmail, Microsoft Exchange Server, Exim.
        *   **Functions:**
            *   Receives email messages from MUAs (using SMTP) or other MTAs (using SMTP).
            *   Examines the recipient's email address (specifically the domain part) to determine the destination MTA.
            *   Uses DNS (specifically MX records) to find the IP address of the recipient's MTA.
            *   Transmits the email message to the next MTA in the path or the final destination MTA (using SMTP).
            *   Handles error conditions (e.g., non-delivery reports/bounces if an email cannot be delivered).

    3.  **Mail Delivery Agent (MDA):**
        *   The MDA is software that accepts an incoming email message from an MTA and delivers it to the appropriate recipient's mailbox on the local mail server.
        *   It is often part of the MTA software or works closely with it.
        *   **Functions:**
            *   Takes the email from the MTA once it has arrived at the destination mail server.
            *   Places the email into the correct user's mailbox file or database.
            *   May perform filtering (e.g., spam filtering) or apply user-defined rules before final delivery.
        *   **Example:** Procmail, or integrated delivery mechanisms within Postfix/Exchange.

    4.  **Mail Access Protocols (POP3 & IMAP):**
        *   These are protocols used by MUAs to retrieve emails from a user's mailbox on a mail server.
        *   **POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3):** Typically downloads emails to the client device and often deletes them from the server. Simpler, less server storage needed.
        *   **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):** Allows users to view and manage emails directly on the server. Emails remain on the server, and changes are synchronized across multiple MUAs used by the same user. More flexible, supports folders on the server.

*   **Simplified Flow of an Email:**

    1.  **Composition:** User Alice (`alice@sender.com`) composes an email using her MUA (e.g., Outlook).
    2.  **Sending (MUA to Sender's MTA):** Alice's MUA sends the email to her organization's MTA (e.g., `mail.sender.com`) using SMTP.
    3.  **Transfer (Sender's MTA to Receiver's MTA):**
        *   `mail.sender.com` (Alice's MTA) looks up the MX record for `receiver.org` (Bob's domain) in DNS to find Bob's MTA (e.g., `mail.receiver.org`).
        *   `mail.sender.com` connects to `mail.receiver.org` using SMTP and transmits the email.
    4.  **Delivery (Receiver's MTA to MDA to Mailbox):**
        *   `mail.receiver.org` (Bob's MTA) receives the email.
        *   The MDA on `mail.receiver.org` takes the email and places it into Bob's mailbox (`bob@receiver.org`).
    5.  **Retrieval (MUA from Receiver's Mailbox):** Bob (`bob@receiver.org`) uses his MUA (e.g., Gmail web interface) to connect to `mail.receiver.org` using IMAP or POP3 and retrieves/reads the new email.

    *   **Diagram (Conceptual):**
        ```
        Alice's MUA --SMTP--> Sender's MTA --SMTP--> Internet --SMTP--> Receiver's MTA --> MDA --> Bob's Mailbox
                                                                                                    ^ 
                                                                                                    | (POP3/IMAP)
                                                                                                    Bob's MUA
        ```
