## 2. Topic: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

### **TCP Characteristics**

*   **Overview:** TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite. It provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets (bytes) between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol.

*   **Key Characteristics:**

    1.  **Connection-Oriented:**
        *   **Handshake Required:** Before any data transfer can begin, TCP requires a connection establishment phase called a **three-way handshake**. Similarly, a connection termination phase (typically a four-way handshake) is used to close the connection.
        *   **Logical Connection:** This handshake establishes a logical end-to-end connection between the two communicating application processes. Both ends of the connection maintain state information about the connection (e.g., sequence numbers, window sizes).
        *   **Contrast with UDP:** UDP is connectionless and requires no prior setup.

    2.  **Reliable Data Transfer:**
        *   **Guaranteed Delivery:** TCP is designed to ensure that data sent by one process is received completely and correctly by the other process.
        *   **Mechanisms for Reliability:**
            *   **Sequence Numbers:** Each byte of data in the stream is assigned a sequence number. TCP uses these to reorder segments that arrive out of order and to detect missing segments.
            *   **Acknowledgements (ACKs):** The receiver sends acknowledgements back to the sender to confirm receipt of data segments. ACKs are typically cumulative, meaning an ACK for sequence number `X` implies all bytes up to `X-1` have been received.
            *   **Retransmissions:** If the sender does not receive an ACK for a segment within a certain timeout period, or if it receives duplicate ACKs indicating a likely loss, it retransmits the lost segment.
            *   **Checksum:** Included in each TCP segment to detect bit errors in both the header and data. Corrupted segments are typically discarded and not acknowledged, leading to a retransmission.

    3.  **Byte-Stream Service (Ordered Delivery):**
        *   **Continuous Stream:** TCP presents data to the application as a continuous, ordered stream of bytes, not as individual messages or packets (unlike UDP's message-oriented service).
        *   **No Message Boundaries:** TCP itself does not preserve application-defined message boundaries. The application sends a stream of bytes, and TCP may segment this stream into TCP segments of various sizes for transmission. The receiving application reads a stream of bytes, and it's up to the application layer to parse out its own message boundaries if needed.
        *   **In-Order Delivery:** TCP ensures that data is delivered to the receiving application process in the same order it was sent by the sending application process. The receiver uses sequence numbers to reassemble the byte stream correctly before passing it to the application.

    4.  **Full-Duplex Communication:**
        *   **Bidirectional Data Flow:** Once a TCP connection is established, data can flow in both directions simultaneously over the same connection.
        *   **Separate Sequence Numbers:** Each direction of data flow uses its own sequence numbers and acknowledgements.

    5.  **Flow Control:**
        *   **Purpose:** To prevent a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver with too much data too quickly.
        *   **Mechanism (Sliding Window):**
            *   The TCP receiver advertises a **receive window (rwnd)** in its segments sent back to the sender. This window size indicates the amount of buffer space currently available at the receiver for incoming data.
            *   The sender ensures that the amount of unacknowledged data it has "in flight" (sent but not yet ACKed) does not exceed the receiver's advertised window size.
            *   This is a form of end-to-end flow control.

    6.  **Congestion Control:**
        *   **Purpose:** To prevent a single TCP connection or multiple TCP connections from overwhelming the network itself (i.e., intermediate routers and links).
        *   **Mechanisms:** TCP senders employ various algorithms (e.g., Slow Start, Congestion Avoidance (AIMD - Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease), Fast Retransmit, Fast Recovery) to probe the network for available capacity and adjust their sending rate based on perceived congestion (inferred from packet loss via timeouts or duplicate ACKs).
        *   **Shared Responsibility:** Congestion control is a critical mechanism for the overall stability and efficiency of the Internet.

*   **TCP Segments:**
    *   The unit of data exchanged between TCP peers is called a **segment**. TCP encapsulates application data into segments, adding a TCP header to each. 

### **TCP Header Format**

*   **Structure:** The TCP header is more complex than the UDP header due to the many features TCP provides (reliability, connection management, flow control, etc.). The minimum TCP header size is 20 bytes (if no options are present), and it can go up to 60 bytes (with options).

    ```
    *(Simplified view focusing on key fields. "Reserved" is 6 bits. Flags are individual bits.)*

*   **Key Field Explanations:**

    1.  **Source Port (16 bits):**
        *   Identifies the port number of the sending application process.

    2.  **Destination Port (16 bits):**
        *   Identifies the port number of the receiving application process.

    3.  **Sequence Number (32 bits):**
        *   Crucial for reliable, ordered delivery.
        *   If the `SYN` flag is set (1), this is the Initial Sequence Number (ISN), and the first data byte is ISN+1.
        *   If `SYN` is clear (0), this is the sequence number of the first data byte in this segment's payload.
        *   Used to order segments and detect missing segments.

    4.  **Acknowledgment Number (32 bits):**
        *   Used by the receiver to acknowledge data received from the sender.
        *   If the `ACK` control bit is set, this field contains the value of the *next sequence number* the sender of the acknowledgment is expecting to receive.
        *   It confirms receipt of all prior bytes (cumulative acknowledgment).

    5.  **Data Offset (Header Length) (4 bits):**
        *   Specifies the size of the TCP header in 32-bit words (i.e., in multiples of 4 bytes).
        *   The minimum value for a correct header is 5 (for a 20-byte header without options).
        *   This field indicates where the actual data begins within the segment.

    6.  **Reserved (6 bits):**
        *   Set to zero. Reserved for future use.

    7.  **Flags (Control Bits) (typically 6 bits, though more are defined):** These are vital for connection management and data transfer.
        *   **`URG` (Urgent Pointer field significant):** Indicates that the Urgent Pointer field is valid and points to urgent data.
        *   **`ACK` (Acknowledgment field significant):** Indicates that the Acknowledgment Number field is valid. Most segments after connection establishment have this flag set.
        *   **`PSH` (Push Function):** Asks the receiver to "push" the data to the receiving application as soon as possible, without necessarily waiting for its buffer to fill. Its exact implementation can vary.
        *   **`RST` (Reset the connection):** Aborts the connection due to an error or refusal. For example, if a segment arrives for a non-existent connection.
        *   **`SYN` (Synchronize sequence numbers):** Used during connection establishment. Only the first two segments of the 3-way handshake set this flag (client's initial request, server's response).
        *   **`FIN` (No more data from sender / Finish):** Used to terminate a connection. Indicates that the sender has finished sending data.

    8.  **Window Size (16 bits):**
        *   Used for flow control.
        *   Specifies the number of data bytes (starting from the byte indicated in the Acknowledgment Number field) that the sender of this segment is currently willing to receive.
        *   Essentially, it's the size of the receive buffer (receive window) on the sender of this segment for the *other* direction of data flow.

    9.  **Checksum (16 bits):**
        *   Used for error detection in the TCP header, TCP payload (data), and a pseudo-header (parts of the IP header: source IP, destination IP, protocol number, TCP segment length).
        *   Calculation is mandatory for TCP.

    10. **Urgent Pointer (16 bits):**
        *   If the `URG` flag is set, this field is an offset from the current sequence number indicating where urgent data ends.
        *   This mechanism allows the sender to send out-of-band data to the receiver without waiting for the normal data stream processing. Rarely used in modern applications.

    11. **Options (Variable length, up to 40 bytes):**
        *   If the Data Offset is greater than 5, this indicates the presence of options.
        *   Common options include:
            *   **Maximum Segment Size (MSS):** Sender specifies the largest segment it can receive.
            *   **Window Scale Factor:** Allows for larger window sizes than 65,535 bytes, for high-speed, long-delay paths.
            *   **Timestamps:** Used for better Round Trip Time (RTT) estimation and protection against wrapped sequence numbers (PAWS).
            *   **Selective Acknowledgments (SACK):** Allows the receiver to acknowledge non-contiguous blocks of received data, improving performance on lossy links.

*   **Exam Angle (from pyqs.md):**
    *   **"Draw and explain header":**
        *   Draw a simplified TCP header, clearly labeling key fields like Source/Destination Port, Sequence Number, Acknowledgment Number, Header Length (Data Offset), Flags (URG, ACK, PSH, RST, SYN, FIN), Window Size, Checksum, and Urgent Pointer. Mention Options field.
        *   Explain the purpose and bit-length of each of these key fields in detail.
    *   **"Compare with UDP header":**
        *   **Common Fields:** Source Port, Destination Port, Checksum (though TCP checksum is mandatory and covers pseudo-header, UDP's is optional in IPv4).
        *   **Fields in TCP not in UDP and Why:**
            *   **Sequence Number:** For reliable, ordered delivery (UDP is unreliable, unordered).
            *   **Acknowledgment Number:** For ACKs in reliable delivery (UDP has no ACKs).
            *   **Header Length (Data Offset):** TCP header is variable due to options (UDP header fixed at 8 bytes).
            *   **Flags (SYN, ACK, FIN, RST etc.):** For connection management (setup, teardown, reset) and signaling (UDP is connectionless).
            *   **Window Size:** For flow control (UDP has no flow control).
            *   **Urgent Pointer:** For urgent data (UDP has no such concept).
            *   **Options Field:** For extensions like MSS, Window Scale, SACK (UDP has no options).
        *   The "Why" should relate back to the fundamental differences: TCP is connection-oriented, reliable, and feature-rich, while UDP is connectionless, unreliable, and simple.
    *   **"List fields in TCP not in UDP and why":** Focus on the fields listed above and their purpose in enabling TCP's services that UDP lacks. 

### **TCP Connection Establishment (3-Way Handshake)**

*   **Purpose:** Before TCP can start transmitting application data, a reliable connection must be established between the two communicating parties (client and server). The 3-way handshake achieves this by:
    *   Allowing both sides to agree upon and initialize sequence numbers for data transmission.
    *   Ensuring both sides are ready to communicate.
    *   Allowing exchange of TCP parameters like Maximum Segment Size (MSS) via options.

*   **Process (Client Initiates):**

    Let's assume the client initiates the connection to a server that is passively listening for connection requests.

    **Diagram:**

    ```
    Client                                     Server
    ------                                     ------
    CLOSED                                     LISTEN

    1. SYN_SENT    -- SYN (Seq=J) --------------> SYN_RCVD
                   (Client ISN = J)

    2. ESTABLISHED <-- SYN+ACK (Seq=K, Ack=J+1) -- SYN_RCVD
                   (Server ISN = K)

    3. ESTABLISHED -- ACK (Seq=J+1, Ack=K+1) ---> ESTABLISHED
    ```

*   **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

    1.  **Step 1: Client sends SYN segment (Client -> Server)**
        *   **Action:** The client, wanting to establish a connection, sends a TCP segment to the server.
        *   **Flags:** The `SYN` (Synchronize) flag in the TCP header is set to 1.
        *   **Sequence Number (Seq):** The client chooses an Initial Sequence Number (ISN), let's call it `J`. This value is placed in the Sequence Number field of the SYN segment. (So, `Seq=J`).
        *   **Acknowledgement Number (Ack):** This field is not yet meaningful as no data has been received from the server yet.
        *   **(Optional) Options:** The client may include options like its Maximum Segment Size (MSS).
        *   **Client State:** The client transitions from `CLOSED` to `SYN_SENT` state, waiting for the server's response.

    2.  **Step 2: Server sends SYN+ACK segment (Server -> Client)**
        *   **Action:** If the server accepts the connection request:
            *   It allocates buffers and variables for the connection.
            *   It sends a TCP segment back to the client.
        *   **Flags:**
            *   The `SYN` flag is set to 1.
            *   The `ACK` flag is set to 1 (to acknowledge the client's SYN).
        *   **Sequence Number (Seq):** The server chooses its own Initial Sequence Number (ISN), let's call it `K`. This is placed in the Sequence Number field. (So, `Seq=K`).
        *   **Acknowledgement Number (Ack):** The server acknowledges the client's SYN by setting the Acknowledgment Number to `J+1` (the client's ISN plus one). (So, `Ack=J+1`).
        *   **(Optional) Options:** The server may include its own options (e.g., its MSS).
        *   **Server State:** The server transitions from `LISTEN` to `SYN_RCVD` state, waiting for the final ACK from the client.

    3.  **Step 3: Client sends ACK segment (Client -> Server)**
        *   **Action:** Upon receiving the server's SYN+ACK segment, the client:
            *   Allocates buffers and variables for the connection.
            *   Sends a TCP segment back to the server.
        *   **Flags:** The `ACK` flag is set to 1.
The `SYN` flag is now 0, as this segment is not for synchronizing sequence numbers but for acknowledging the server's SYN.
        *   **Sequence Number (Seq):** The client sets its sequence number to `J+1` (its initial sequence number plus one, acknowledging the consumption of the server's SYN flag, which conceptually occupies one sequence number space).
        *   **Acknowledgement Number (Ack):** The client acknowledges the server's SYN by setting the Acknowledgment Number to `K+1` (the server's ISN plus one).
        *   **Client State:** The client transitions from `SYN_SENT` to `ESTABLISHED` state. Data transfer can now begin from the client's side.
        *   **Server State:** When the server receives this ACK segment, it transitions from `SYN_RCVD` to `ESTABLISHED` state. Data transfer can now begin from the server's side as well.

*   **Purpose of Each Step in Detail:**
    *   **Client's SYN (Step 1):** Informs the server that the client wants to establish a connection and proposes the client's initial sequence number (J).
    *   **Server's SYN+ACK (Step 2):**
        *   Acknowledges the client's request (Ack=J+1).
        *   Informs the client that the server is also willing to establish a connection.
        *   Proposes the server's initial sequence number (K).
    *   **Client's ACK (Step 3):**
        *   Acknowledges the server's parameters (Ack=K+1).
        *   Completes the establishment of the two-way communication path.

*   **Why ISNs are Random:** Initial Sequence Numbers are chosen pseudo-randomly to prevent potential attacks like connection hijacking or spoofing, especially from segments from previous, now-terminated connections that might still be lingering in the network (delayed segments).

*   **Exam Angle (from pyqs.md):**
    *   **"Explain connection establishment":**
        *   Describe the 3-way handshake step-by-step.
        *   Clearly state which flags are set in each segment (SYN, ACK).
        *   Explain how sequence numbers (J, K) and acknowledgment numbers (J+1, K+1) are used.
        *   Mention the purpose: to synchronize sequence numbers and confirm both sides are ready.
    *   **"Diagram":**
        *   Draw a clear timeline diagram showing the three segments exchanged between client and server.
        *   Label each segment with the key flags (SYN, ACK) and the Seq/Ack numbers (e.g., SYN, Seq=J; SYN+ACK, Seq=K, Ack=J+1; ACK, Seq=J+1, Ack=K+1).
        *   Optionally show client/server states (e.g., SYN_SENT, SYN_RCVD, ESTABLISHED). 

### **TCP Connection Release (4-Way Handshake)**

*   **Purpose:** To gracefully terminate a TCP connection. Since TCP connections are full-duplex, each direction of data flow must be shut down independently. This usually results in a 4-way handshake.

*   **Process (Assuming Client Initiates Closure):**

    **Diagram (4-Way Handshake):**

    ```
    Client (Active Closer)                     Server (Passive Closer)
    ----------------------                     -----------------------
    ESTABLISHED                                ESTABLISHED

    (Application on client decides to close)

    1. FIN_WAIT_1  -- FIN (Seq=X) --------------> CLOSE_WAIT
                   (Client has no more data)

    2. FIN_WAIT_1  <-- ACK (Ack=X+1) ----------- CLOSE_WAIT
                   (Server acknowledges client's FIN)

    (Server application finishes sending its data, then decides to close)

    3. FIN_WAIT_2  <-- FIN (Seq=Y) ----------- LAST_ACK
                   (Server has no more data)

    4. TIME_WAIT   -- ACK (Ack=Y+1) ------------> CLOSED
                   (Client acknowledges server's FIN)

    (Client waits in TIME_WAIT for 2*MSL before closing)
    ```

*   **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

    1.  **Step 1: Client sends FIN segment (Client -> Server)**
        *   **Action:** The client application, having no more data to send, decides to close its side of the connection. It sends a TCP segment with the `FIN` (Finish) flag set to 1.
        *   **Flags:** `FIN=1`, `ACK` might also be set if acknowledging previous data from server.
        *   **Sequence Number (Seq):** Let the client's current sequence number be `X`. The FIN flag conceptually consumes one sequence number. So, `Seq=X`.
        *   **Client State:** Client transitions from `ESTABLISHED` to `FIN_WAIT_1`.
        *   **Effect:** The client will no longer send data but can still receive data from the server.

    2.  **Step 2: Server sends ACK segment (Server -> Client)**
        *   **Action:** The server receives the client's FIN segment. It sends an `ACK` segment back to the client to acknowledge receipt of the FIN.
        *   **Flags:** `ACK=1`.
        *   **Acknowledgment Number (Ack):** The server acknowledges the client's FIN by setting `Ack=X+1`.
        *   **Server State:** Server transitions from `ESTABLISHED` to `CLOSE_WAIT`.
        *   **Effect:** The server's application is informed that the client has finished sending data. The server can still send data to the client if it has any remaining.
        *   **Client State:** Upon receiving this ACK, the client transitions from `FIN_WAIT_1` to `FIN_WAIT_2`.

    3.  **Step 3: Server sends FIN segment (Server -> Client)**
        *   **Action:** Once the server application also has no more data to send, it closes its side of the connection by sending a TCP segment with the `FIN` flag set to 1.
        *   **Flags:** `FIN=1`, `ACK` might also be set (piggybacking ACK for any data client sent before its FIN).
        *   **Sequence Number (Seq):** Let the server's current sequence number be `Y`. So, `Seq=Y`.
        *   **Server State:** Server transitions from `CLOSE_WAIT` to `LAST_ACK`.

    4.  **Step 4: Client sends ACK segment (Client -> Server)**
        *   **Action:** The client receives the server's FIN segment and sends an `ACK` segment back to acknowledge it.
        *   **Flags:** `ACK=1`.
        *   **Acknowledgment Number (Ack):** The client acknowledges the server's FIN by setting `Ack=Y+1`.
        *   **Client State:** Client transitions from `FIN_WAIT_2` to `TIME_WAIT`.
        *   **Server State:** Upon receiving this final ACK, the server transitions to `CLOSED`. The connection resources on the server side are released.

*   **TIME_WAIT State (Client Side):**
    *   After sending the final ACK, the client enters the `TIME_WAIT` state (also known as 2MSL wait state).
    *   **MSL (Maximum Segment Lifetime):** The maximum time a segment can exist in the network before being discarded (typically 30 seconds, 1 minute, or 2 minutes).
    *   **Purpose:** The client waits for a period of 2 * MSL to ensure:
        1.  Its final ACK was received by the server. If the ACK is lost, the server will retransmit its FIN, and the client in `TIME_WAIT` can re-send the ACK.
        2.  Any delayed segments from the current connection that might still be lingering in the network have expired, preventing them from being misinterpreted as part of a new, subsequent connection with the same port numbers.
    *   After 2*MSL, the client transitions to `CLOSED`, and its resources are released.

*   **Half-Close:**
    *   TCP allows for a "half-close" where one side (e.g., the client) can stop sending data (sends FIN) but continue receiving data from the other side. The other side (server) can continue sending data until it also decides to close by sending its FIN.

*   **3-Way Handshake for Release (Piggybacking FIN+ACK):**
    *   It's possible for the server's ACK for the client's FIN (Step 2) and the server's own FIN (Step 3) to be combined into a single segment if the server has no more data to send immediately after receiving the client's FIN.
    *   **Diagram (Conceptual for 3-way release):**
        ```
        Client                                     Server
        ------                                     ------
        1. FIN_WAIT_1  -- FIN (Seq=X) --------------> (Server receives FIN)

        2. FIN_WAIT_2  <-- FIN+ACK (Seq=Y, Ack=X+1) -- LAST_ACK
                        (Server sends its FIN and ACKs client's FIN)

        3. TIME_WAIT   -- ACK (Ack=Y+1) ------------> CLOSED
        ```
    *   This reduces the number of segments from 4 to 3.

*   **Simultaneous Close:**
    *   It's also possible for both sides to decide to close simultaneously, both sending FINs around the same time. This leads to a slightly different state transition sequence but still results in a clean shutdown.

### **TCP Flow Control (Sliding Window)**

*   **Concept and Purpose:**
    *   TCP flow control is a mechanism to prevent a fast TCP sender from overwhelming a slow TCP receiver with too much data too quickly.
    *   If the sender transmits data faster than the receiver can process it, the receiver's input buffer can overflow, leading to data loss and inefficient retransmissions.
    *   Flow control ensures that the sender only transmits data that the receiver has buffer space for.
    *   It is an **end-to-end** mechanism, managed between the two communicating TCP entities.

*   **Mechanism: Sliding Window (Receiver-Advertised Window):**

    1.  **Receive Buffer:** The TCP receiver has a finite-sized receive buffer to store incoming data before it is read by the application process.

    2.  **Advertised Window (Window Size Field):**
        *   The key to TCP flow control is the **Window Size** field in the TCP header.
        *   In every segment it sends back to the sender (including pure ACKs), the **receiver advertises its current available buffer space** in this Window Size field. This is often called the **receive window (rwnd)**.
        *   `rwnd = ReceiverBufferCapacity - (LastByteReceived - LastByteReadByApplication)`
        *   This value tells the sender how many more bytes of data it can send *without overflowing the receiver's buffer*.

    3.  **Sender Action:**
        *   The TCP sender maintains a **send window**. The size of this send window is constrained by two factors: the receiver's advertised window (rwnd) and the congestion window (cwnd - for congestion control, discussed separately).
        *   For flow control, the sender must ensure that the amount of **unacknowledged data** it has in flight (i.e., `LastByteSent - LastByteAcked`) is less than or equal to the `rwnd` advertised by the receiver.
        *   `EffectiveWindow = min(rwnd, cwnd)`
        *   The sender "slides" its window forward as it sends data and receives acknowledgments.

    4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:**
        *   As the receiving application reads data from its buffer, more space becomes available.
        *   The receiver then advertises a larger `rwnd` in subsequent segments to the sender, allowing the sender to transmit more data.
        *   If the receiving application is slow, the buffer fills up, and the receiver advertises a smaller `rwnd` (or even zero), causing the sender to slow down or stop.

*   **Zero Window Condition:**
    *   If the receiver advertises a `rwnd` of 0, it means its receive buffer is full, and it cannot accept any more data at that moment.
    *   The sender, upon receiving a zero window advertisement, must **stop sending data segments** (except for certain probes, see below).
    *   **Deadlock Potential:** If the sender stops and the receiver subsequently clears buffer space but the ACK segment carrying the new non-zero window update is lost, both sides might wait indefinitely (sender waiting for window update, receiver waiting for data).
    *   **Zero Window Probe (Persistence Timer):** To prevent this deadlock, when a sender receives a zero window, it starts a **persistence timer**. When this timer expires, the sender sends a small "probe" segment (typically 1 byte of data, or just a header) to the receiver.
        *   This probe forces the receiver to resend an ACK containing its current `rwnd`.
        *   If the window is still zero, the sender resets the persistence timer (often with an exponentially increasing backoff interval) and probes again later.
        *   If the window is now non-zero, the sender can resume data transmission.

*   **Relationship with Sliding Window ARQ (from DLL):**
    *   The concept is similar to sliding window protocols at the Data Link Layer (like Go-Back-N or Selective Repeat), where a window limits the number of frames that can be sent without acknowledgment.
    *   However, TCP's sliding window is **byte-oriented** (sequence numbers and window sizes refer to bytes, not segments), whereas DLL sliding windows are typically frame-oriented.
    *   TCP's window size is variable and dynamically advertised by the receiver, whereas in some DLL protocols, window sizes might be fixed or less dynamic.

*   **Exam Angle (from pyqs.md):**
    *   **"Discuss TCP flow control":**
        *   Explain the purpose: prevent overwhelming the receiver.
        *   Describe the sliding window mechanism: receiver advertises its available buffer space (receive window or `rwnd`) in the Window Size field of the TCP header.
        *   Explain how the sender uses this `rwnd` to limit the amount of unacknowledged data it sends.
        *   Discuss the zero-window condition and how the persistence timer (zero window probes) prevents deadlock.
        *   Mention it's an end-to-end mechanism.

### **TCP Congestion Control**

*   **Purpose:**
    *   While flow control prevents the sender from overwhelming the *receiver*, congestion control prevents the sender (or multiple senders) from overwhelming the *network* (i.e., intermediate routers and links).
    *   Network congestion occurs when routers' buffers start to overflow due to too much traffic, leading to packet loss, increased delays, and reduced throughput.
    *   TCP congestion control aims to be a "good network citizen" by adjusting the sending rate based on perceived network conditions.

*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Congestion Window (cwnd):** The sender maintains a state variable called the congestion window (`cwnd`). This limits how much data the sender can have in flight (unacknowledged) due to network capacity concerns. The actual amount of data a sender can send is `min(cwnd, rwnd)` where `rwnd` is the receiver's advertised flow control window.
    *   **Self-Clocking:** TCP uses ACKs returning from the receiver as a form of "clock" to gauge when it's safe to inject new segments into the network. If ACKs arrive quickly, the network is likely clear; if they are delayed or lost, congestion is likely.
    *   **Inferring Congestion:** TCP doesn't get explicit congestion signals from routers (in its basic form, though ECN - Explicit Congestion Notification exists as an extension). Instead, it infers congestion primarily through:
        *   **Packet Loss (detected by Timeout):** If a sender doesn't receive an ACK for a segment within its retransmission timeout (RTO) period, it assumes the segment (or its ACK) was lost due to congestion.
        *   **Packet Loss (detected by Triple Duplicate ACKs):** If a sender receives three ACKs for the same sequence number (meaning the receiver got three segments after a missing one), it's a strong indication that the segment immediately following the acknowledged one was lost. This is often a less severe sign of congestion than a timeout.

*   **Core Mechanisms (Phases of TCP Congestion Control - e.g., TCP Reno/Tahoe variants):**

    1.  **Slow Start (SS):**
        *   **Goal:** To quickly probe for available network bandwidth at the beginning of a connection or after a connection has been idle or after a timeout-detected loss.
        *   **Mechanism:** `cwnd` is initialized to a small value (typically 1 to 4 MSS - Maximum Segment Size).
        *   For each ACK received, `cwnd` is increased by 1 MSS. This results in an **exponential increase** of `cwnd` (e.g., 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 8 MSS...) per Round Trip Time (RTT).
        *   **Ends When:** Slow Start typically ends when `cwnd` reaches a **Slow Start Threshold (ssthresh)**, or when packet loss is detected.

    2.  **Congestion Avoidance (CA):**
        *   **Goal:** Once `cwnd` is above `ssthresh`, TCP enters a more conservative phase to avoid causing congestion by increasing its sending rate too rapidly.
        *   **Mechanism (Additive Increase):** For each RTT (roughly, for each full window of ACKs received without loss), `cwnd` is increased by approximately 1 MSS. This is a linear (additive) increase.
            *   More precisely, `cwnd = cwnd + MSS * (MSS / cwnd)` for each ACK received. This approximates to adding 1 MSS per RTT.
        *   **Continues Until:** Packet loss is detected.

    3.  **Congestion Detection and Response (Multiplicative Decrease):**
        *   **If Timeout Occurs (Severe Congestion):**
            *   `ssthresh` is set to `max(2 * MSS, cwnd / 2)` (halve the current congestion window).
            *   `cwnd` is reset to 1 MSS.
            *   The sender re-enters the **Slow Start** phase.
            *   (This is typical of TCP Tahoe behavior. TCP Reno and NewReno are more aggressive after a timeout but still reduce `cwnd` significantly).

        *   **If Triple Duplicate ACKs Occur (Less Severe Congestion - Fast Retransmit & Fast Recovery):**
            *   **Fast Retransmit:** The sender immediately retransmits the missing segment (indicated by the duplicate ACKs) without waiting for a timeout.
            *   **Fast Recovery (e.g., TCP Reno):**
                *   `ssthresh` is set to `cwnd / 2`.
                *   `cwnd` is set to `ssthresh + 3 * MSS` (to account for the segments that successfully left the network and triggered the duplicate ACKs).
                *   For each additional duplicate ACK received, `cwnd` is inflated by 1 MSS (as if more segments are leaving the network).
                *   When the ACK for the retransmitted segment arrives: `cwnd` is deflated back to `ssthresh` (or slightly above), and TCP transitions to **Congestion Avoidance**, not Slow Start. This avoids drastically reducing the sending rate for what might be a single packet loss.

*   **AIMD (Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease):**
    *   The overall behavior of TCP congestion control, especially in the Congestion Avoidance phase combined with the response to packet loss, is often described as AIMD.
    *   **Additive Increase:** `cwnd` increases linearly when no congestion is perceived.
    *   **Multiplicative Decrease:** `cwnd` is reduced significantly (often halved or more) when congestion is detected.
    *   This strategy is proven to be stable and fair when multiple TCP flows share a bottleneck link.

*   **Visualizing `cwnd` Behavior:**
    *   A common graph shows `cwnd` on the y-axis and time on the x-axis.
    *   It typically shows phases of exponential growth (Slow Start), then linear growth (Congestion Avoidance), followed by sharp drops upon congestion detection, and then the recovery process.

*   **Exam Angle (from pyqs.md):**
    *   **"Discuss TCP congestion control":**
        *   Explain the purpose: prevent overwhelming the network.
        *   Define `cwnd` and `ssthresh`.
        *   Describe the main phases/mechanisms:
            *   Slow Start (exponential increase).
            *   Congestion Avoidance (additive/linear increase).
            *   How congestion is detected (timeouts, triple duplicate ACKs).
            *   How TCP responds to each type of detection (multiplicative decrease - e.g., halving `ssthresh`, resetting `cwnd`, potentially re-entering Slow Start or using Fast Recovery).
        *   Briefly explain AIMD.
    *   **"Short Note on TCP Congestion Control":** A concise summary of the above points.
    *   **"AIMD, Slow Start":** Focus on explaining these specific components in detail.
    *   **TCP Throughput Problem (e.g., May 2024 Q6):**
        *   **Understanding the relationship:** TCP throughput is fundamentally limited by how much data can be "in flight" (window size) divided by the time it takes for that data to be acknowledged (RTT).
        *   **Formula (Simplified, ignoring slow start and assuming no loss for max ideal throughput):** `Throughput ≈ WindowSize / RTT`
        *   **Key factors in problems:**
            *   **Window Size (W):** This could be the congestion window (`cwnd`) or the receiver's advertised window (`rwnd`), or `min(cwnd, rwnd)`. Problems often give it or ask you to relate it to MSS.
            *   **Round Trip Time (RTT):** Time for a segment to go from sender to receiver and an ACK to come back.
            *   **Maximum Segment Size (MSS):** The amount of application data in a single TCP segment.
            *   **Packet Loss Rate (p):** More advanced models (like the Mathis formula or Padhye formula for average throughput in the presence of loss) incorporate the loss rate. For simpler problems, you might be asked to calculate how `cwnd` evolves over time with loss events.
        *   **Typical Problem Scenario:** Given RTT, MSS, and perhaps an initial `cwnd` and `ssthresh`, trace how `cwnd` evolves over several RTTs, especially if a loss event occurs. Calculate average window size or time to send a certain amount of data.
        *   **Practice Specifics:**
            *   Show how `cwnd` increases in Slow Start (doubles each RTT: 1, 2, 4, 8... MSS).
            *   Show how `cwnd` increases in Congestion Avoidance (+1 MSS per RTT).
            *   Show what happens to `ssthresh` and `cwnd` upon a timeout-detected loss.
            *   Show what happens to `ssthresh` and `cwnd` upon a triple-duplicate-ACK-detected loss (Fast Retransmit/Recovery).
            *   Be prepared to draw a `cwnd` vs. time graph.
