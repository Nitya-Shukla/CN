# Day 3: MEGA REVISION & Practice

This section outlines key activities for a comprehensive revision and practice session, drawing from both the `plan.md` and `study_checklist.md`.

## Core Revision Strategies (from plan.md):

*   **Go through the ENTIRE deduplicated list of questions (from pyqs.md):**
    *   For each question, mentally outline or jot down key points on how you would structure your answer. This helps in recalling information and organizing thoughts effectively.

*   **Prioritize areas you feel weakest in:**
    *   Identify topics where your understanding is less confident. Dedicate focused time to review the detailed notes and concepts related to these specific areas.

*   **Rework numerical problems:**
    *   Actively practice solving numerical problems again. Key areas include:
        *   Subnetting calculations
        *   Aloha (Pure and Slotted) throughput
        *   Shannon-Hartley Theorem application
        *   TCP throughput calculations
    *   Aim for both accuracy and speed, ensuring you understand the underlying formulas and steps.

*   **Draw key diagrams from memory:**
    *   Practice reproducing important diagrams without looking at your notes. This is crucial for quick visual recall and effective presentation in an exam setting. Essential diagrams include:
        *   OSI Model (all layers and basic functions)
        *   TCP/IP Model (all layers and basic functions)
        *   TCP Header Format (key fields and their purpose)
        *   UDP Header Format (key fields and their purpose)
        *   Sliding Window Protocol timelines (Stop-and-Wait ARQ, Go-Back-N ARQ, Selective Repeat ARQ) illustrating scenarios like successful transmission, lost frame, and lost ACK.
        *   TCP 3-way handshake (flag sequence and purpose)
        *   TCP 4-way connection release (flag sequence and purpose)

*   **Practice Short Note Questions:**
    *   For common short note topics identified from `pyqs.md` and the study plan, practice formulating 2-3 concise, accurate key points for each.

*   **Understand Exam Structure:**
    *   Review the format of actual past question papers. Pay attention to:
        *   Number of choices available per section/question.
        *   Marks allocated to different questions/parts.
        *   Typical question phrasing and common instruction verbs (e.g., "Explain," "Compare," "Calculate," "Draw").
    *   This familiarity helps in strategizing time management and approach during the actual exam.

## Additional Practice Techniques (from study_checklist.md):

*   **Use active recall:**
    *   Don't just passively re-read your notes. Actively test your memory by covering your notes and trying to explain concepts aloud or write down the main points from scratch.

*   **Simulate Exam Conditions:**
    *   If time permits, attempt to answer a selection of full questions from past papers under a timed environment. This helps you adapt to the pressure and pacing required for the exam.
    *   Focus on structuring your answers clearly and managing your time effectively across different questions.

This structured approach to revision and practice is designed to consolidate your knowledge, build confidence, and enhance your preparedness for the exam.
