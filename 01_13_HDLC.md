# Detailed Answer: HDLC (High-Level Data Link Control)

HDLC (High-Level Data Link Control) is a bit-oriented, synchronous Data Link Layer protocol developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It is a comprehensive and versatile protocol that supports point-to-point and multipoint links, full-duplex communication, and various operational modes. HDLC has been influential, and many other protocols like SDLC, PPP, and Frame Relay are based on its principles or frame structure.

## Key Features of HDLC

*   **Bit-Oriented:** Unlike character-oriented protocols, HDLC frames can contain an arbitrary number of bits and are not tied to character boundaries. Data transparency is achieved using bit stuffing.
*   **Synchronous Transmission:** Requires clock synchronization between sender and receiver.
*   **Error Control:** Uses a strong error detection mechanism (CRC - Cyclic Redundancy Check, typically CRC-16 or CRC-32) in the Frame Check Sequence (FCS) field.
*   **Flow Control:** Employs sliding window mechanisms (Go-Back-N or Selective Repeat, depending on implementation and operational mode).
*   **Supports Different Configurations:**
    *   **Unbalanced Configuration:** One primary station controls one or more secondary stations (e.g., multipoint links).
    *   **Balanced Configuration:** Two combined stations (peers) on a point-to-point link, where either station can initiate transmission.
*   **Operational Modes:**
    *   **Normal Response Mode (NRM):** Used in unbalanced configurations. Secondary stations can only transmit after receiving explicit permission (poll) from the primary station.
    *   **Asynchronous Balanced Mode (ABM):** Used in balanced configurations. Either combined station can initiate transmission without permission from the other.
    *   **Asynchronous Response Mode (ARM):** Less common, allows a secondary to initiate transmission without a poll, but the primary still has control.

## HDLC Frame Format

HDLC defines a standard frame structure. All communication, whether data or control information, occurs in these frames.

```
+------+---------+--------------+-----------------+-----+------+ 
| Flag | Address |   Control    | Information     | FCS | Flag |
| (8)  | (8/16+) | (8 or 16)    | (Variable Length) |(16/32| (8)  |
+------+---------+--------------+-----------------+-----+------+ 
```
*Numbers in parentheses indicate typical bit lengths.*

**1. Flag Field (8 bits)**

*   **Pattern:** `01111110` (a 0 bit, followed by six 1 bits, followed by a 0 bit).
*   **Purpose:** Marks the beginning and end of an HDLC frame. It provides synchronization.
*   **Uniqueness:** To ensure this pattern does not appear accidentally within the other fields of the frame (Address, Control, Information, FCS), HDLC uses **bit stuffing**.
    *   **Bit Stuffing Rule:** On the sender side, if five consecutive '1's appear in the data to be transmitted (between the flags), a '0' is inserted after the fifth '1'.
    *   **Destuffing Rule:** On the receiver side, if five consecutive '1's are followed by a '0', the '0' is removed. If they are followed by a '10', it's recognized as a flag.
*   **Inter-frame Fill:** When no frames are being transmitted, the line can be kept idle, or continuous flags can be sent to maintain synchronization.

**2. Address Field (8 bits, extendable)**

*   **Purpose:** Identifies the secondary station involved in the communication. This field is primarily used in multipoint configurations where a primary station communicates with multiple secondary stations.
*   **Content:**
    *   In NRM (unbalanced): If the frame is sent by the primary, it contains the address of the destination secondary. If sent by a secondary, it contains its own address (source).
    *   In ABM (balanced, point-to-point): The address field might not be strictly needed or can be used to distinguish commands from responses.
*   **Extendable:** The address field can be extended to multiple bytes if more addresses are needed. The least significant bit (LSB) of each byte indicates if it's the last byte of the address (LSB=1 means last, LSB=0 means more bytes follow).

**3. Control Field (8 or 16 bits)**

*   **Purpose:** This is a crucial field that defines the type of HDLC frame and carries control information for managing the link, flow, and error control.
*   **Frame Types:** The first 1 or 2 bits of the control field determine the frame type:
    *   **Information Frames (I-frames):** Carry user data from the network layer. They also include sequence numbers for flow and error control (piggybacking ACKs).
        *   Starts with `0`.
        *   Contains `N(S)`: Send sequence number of this I-frame.
        *   Contains `N(R)`: Receive sequence number, acknowledging frames received from the other side (piggybacked ACK). This is the sequence number of the next I-frame expected.
        *   Contains a `P/F` (Poll/Final) bit.
    *   **Supervisory Frames (S-frames):** Used for flow and error control when piggybacking in I-frames is not possible or appropriate (e.g., when there is no user data to send but an ACK is needed, or to signal receiver status).
        *   Starts with `10`.
        *   Contains `N(R)`: Receive sequence number (acknowledging frames).
        *   Contains a `P/F` (Poll/Final) bit.
        *   Has a **Type** subfield to specify the S-frame function:
            *   `00` = **RR (Receive Ready):** Receiver is ready to receive more I-frames; acknowledges frames up to N(R)-1.
            *   `01` = **REJ (Reject):** Negative acknowledgement for Go-Back-N. Requests retransmission starting from frame N(R).
            *   `10` = **RNR (Receive Not Ready):** Receiver is temporarily busy and cannot accept more I-frames; acknowledges frames up to N(R)-1.
            *   `11` = **SREJ (Selective Reject):** Negative acknowledgement for Selective Repeat. Requests retransmission of only frame N(R).
    *   **Unnumbered Frames (U-frames):** Used for link management purposes, such as link setup, disconnection, and reporting certain error conditions. They do not contain sequence numbers related to data flow.
        *   Starts with `11`.
        *   Contains a `P/F` (Poll/Final) bit.
        *   Has **Modifier bits** that define various U-frame commands and responses (e.g., `SABM`/`SABME` for setting mode, `DISC` for disconnect, `UA` for unnumbered acknowledgement, `FRMR` for frame reject).

*   **P/F (Poll/Final) Bit:**
    *   In command frames (from primary or combined station): `P` bit (Poll bit). When set to 1, it solicits a response from the secondary/other combined station.
    *   In response frames (from secondary or combined station): `F` bit (Final bit). When set to 1, it indicates the last frame of a response to a poll.

**4. Information Field (Variable Length, only in I-frames)**

*   **Purpose:** Contains the actual user data passed down from the Network Layer (e.g., an IP packet).
*   **Presence:** This field is only present in Information (I) frames. It is absent in S-frames and most U-frames.
*   **Length:** Its length can vary up to a system-defined maximum.

**5. Frame Check Sequence (FCS) Field (16 or 32 bits)**

*   **Purpose:** Contains an error detection code calculated over the Address, Control, and Information fields (but not the Flags or stuffed bits). It ensures data integrity.
*   **Mechanism:** Typically uses Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC).
    *   **CRC-CCITT (CRC-16):** `x^16 + x^12 + x^5 + 1` is a common 16-bit generator polynomial.
    *   **CRC-32:** Used in some Ethernet standards and offers stronger error detection.
*   **Calculation:** The sender calculates the FCS and includes it. The receiver recalculates the FCS on the received fields and compares it with the received FCS. If they differ, an error is detected, and the frame is usually discarded.

## Exam Angle Summary (Based on `pyqs.md` and `plan.md`)

When preparing for exams on HDLC:

*   **Frame Format:** This is the most critical part. "Draw the frame format of HDLC protocol and state the function of each field" (May 2024, May 2022, May 2019, Dec 2020). Be able to draw the frame structure clearly and accurately label each field.
*   **Function of Each Field:** For each field (Flag, Address, Control, Information, FCS), explain its purpose in detail.
    *   **Flag:** Delimiting, synchronization, bit stuffing.
    *   **Address:** Identifying secondary station.
    *   **Control:** This is key â€“ explain I-frames, S-frames (RR, RNR, REJ, SREJ), and U-frames (link management). Mention N(S), N(R), and P/F bit.
    *   **Information:** Carries user data (only in I-frames).
    *   **FCS:** Error detection (CRC).
*   **Bit Stuffing:** Although part of framing methods, it's integral to HDLC's flag mechanism, so be ready to explain it in the context of HDLC if asked generally about HDLC operation.
*   **Frame Types:** "Explain different types of frames in HDLC" (Dec 2024). This specifically refers to I, S, and U frames and their subtypes/functions within the Control field.
*   **Do not get bogged down in control field subtypes (plan.md advice):** While the plan suggests not getting bogged down in control field subtypes *unless you have extra time*, you *do* need to know the main types (I, S, U) and the purpose of common S-frames (RR, RNR, REJ, SREJ) as they are fundamental to its operation and often asked about in "function of each field" or "types of frames" questions.

Focus on a clear diagram of the frame format and a concise explanation of each field's role, especially the different types of information conveyed by the Control field.
